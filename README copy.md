Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is widely known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and perform well with a clear margin of separation.

### **Key Concepts of SVM**
1. **Hyperplane**: In SVM, a hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space. For a dataset with \(n\) features, the hyperplane is an \((n-1)\)-dimensional subspace.

2. **Margin**: The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) from either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin to ensure better generalization.

3. **Support Vectors**: These are the data points closest to the hyperplane. They are critical because they determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane.

4. **Linear Separability**: If the data can be separated by a straight line (or a hyperplane in higher dimensions), it is linearly separable.

5. **Kernel Trick**: For non-linearly separable data, SVM uses kernel functions to project the data into a higher-dimensional space where a hyperplane can separate the classes.

### **Mathematical Formulation**
SVM tries to solve the following optimization problem:

#### **Objective: Maximize the Margin**
For a linearly separable dataset, the hyperplane can be represented as:
\[
w \cdot x + b = 0
\]
where:
- \(w\) is the weight vector normal to the hyperplane,
- \(x\) is the input feature vector,
- \(b\) is the bias term.

The decision function for classification is:
\[
f(x) = \text{sign}(w \cdot x + b)
\]

#### **Constraints**:
For a dataset \(\{(x_i, y_i)\}\), where \(x_i\) is the input and \(y_i \in \{-1, +1\}\) is the class label, the constraints are:
\[
y_i (w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1, \quad \forall i
\]

#### **Optimization Problem**:
Minimize:
\[
\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2
\]
subject to the constraints:
\[
y_i (w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1
\]

This optimization ensures a maximum margin by minimizing the norm of the weight vector (\(||w||\)).

### **Non-Linearly Separable Data**
For non-linear cases, SVM introduces:
1. **Soft Margin**: Allows some misclassifications by introducing a slack variable \(\xi_i\):
   \[
   y_i (w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad \xi_i \geq 0
   \]
   The objective becomes:
   \[
   \min \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i
   \]
   where \(C\) controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification errors.

2. **Kernel Function**: Maps data to a higher-dimensional space to make it linearly separable. Common kernels include:
   - Linear Kernel: \(K(x_i, x_j) = x_i \cdot x_j\)
   - Polynomial Kernel: \(K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i \cdot x_j + c)^d\)
   - Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF): \(K(x_i, x_j) = \exp(-\gamma ||x_i - x_j||^2)\)
   - Sigmoid Kernel: \(K(x_i, x_j) = \tanh(\alpha x_i \cdot x_j + c)\)

---

### **Dual Formulation**
The SVM problem is often solved in its dual form using Lagrange multipliers:
\[
\max \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j)
\]
subject to:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i = 0, \quad 0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C
\]
Here:
- \(\alpha_i\) are Lagrange multipliers,
- \(K(x_i, x_j)\) is the kernel function.

---

### **Decision Rule**
After solving for \(w\) and \(b\), the decision rule for classifying a new input \(x\) is:
\[
f(x) = \text{sign} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b \right)
\]

---

### **Advantages**
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Works well with both linear and non-linear boundaries.
- Robust to overfitting with proper parameter tuning.

### **Limitations**
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of the kernel and its parameters.
- Performance can degrade with noisy data or overlapping classes.

SVM is a powerful tool that balances complexity and predictive accuracy, making it a go-to algorithm for many classification and regression problems.
